In Android’s MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, it is common to break complex screens into multiple fragments, each with its own ViewModel and Contract class. However, in some cases, multiple fragments might need to access the same object instance to perform operations, which can create a challenge for developers. One solution to this problem is to use LiveData to share data between ViewModels, allowing each ViewModel to load and update the same data. This approach can help to reduce complexity and improve the overall performance of the application. In this context, the concept of Shared ViewModel and MediatorLiveData can also be helpful. In this article, we will explore the use of LiveData to share data between ViewModels in Android’s MVVM architecture, and we will provide a sample implementation to demonstrate how this approach can be used in practice.
There are different approaches that you can take to share data between ViewModels in MVVM architecture, and the best approach may depend on the specific requirements of your project. Here is an example implementation using a Shared ViewModel approach:
